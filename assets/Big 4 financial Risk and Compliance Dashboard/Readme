📊 Big 4 Financial Risk & Compliance Dashboard
📝 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven analysis of risk and compliance trends across the Big 4 firms (PwC, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) from 2020 to 2024. By analyzing multi-industry data, this dashboard identifies how workload pressure, industry type, and the adoption of AI directly correlate with audit effectiveness and revenue exposure.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel)
Raw data was processed to ensure high-fidelity insights:

Standardization: Cleaned firm names and industry categories across 5 years of records.

Custom Formatting: Applied custom number formats (e.g., $0.0"M") to make multi-billion dollar figures readable at a glance.

Conditional Formatting: Used heatmaps to highlight "Hotspots" in Retail and Healthcare risk zones.

2. Dashboard Architecture
The visualization layer was built using:

PivotTables: To aggregate complex compliance metrics and revenue impacts.

PivotCharts: To visualize trends in auditor satisfaction vs. audit effectiveness.

Slicers & Timelines: Allowing users to filter by Firm, Year (2020-2024), and Industry.

🔍 Key Findings & Insights
🤖 The AI Gap
Data shows a significant performance delta between AI-integrated audits and traditional manual audits.

Non-AI Audits: Consistently score lower in effectiveness and client satisfaction.

AI Audits: Demonstrate higher anomaly detection rates and faster turnaround times.

🏥 Industry Hotspots
Retail, Healthcare, and Tech represent the highest risk profiles. These sectors carry billions in revenue exposure due to complex regulatory frameworks and high transaction volumes.

⚖️ Workload & Fraud Correlation
The analysis reveals a "Breaking Point" for auditor performance:

The Sweet Spot: Workload scores between 50–70 yield the highest satisfaction and lowest error rates.

The Risk Zone: Workload scores exceeding 80 show a direct spike in fraud overlooked and compliance violations.

✅ Strategic Solutions
Based on the data, the following strategies are recommended for the Big 4 firms:

Category	Action Plan
Technology	Scale AI adoption to close the effectiveness gap in non-AI sectors.
Specialization	Develop industry-specific audit frameworks for Healthcare and Retail.
Resource Management	Cap auditor workload at a 70-point index to maintain audit integrity.
Risk Mitigation	Prioritize high-exposure audits to protect billions in potential revenue loss.
